    <description><![CDATA[<p>For the longest time, I spent a lot of time hemming and hawing and hewing about what kind of entity system to use for my game. I used to use an inheritance hierarchy back in college, but object oriented programming has been falling out, especially with game programming. It wasn't very flexible and wrecked the cache. The two most common entity systems I see today are arrays of structs (entities) that owned other structs (components), or arrays of components, and entities are just indices that map to these components.</p> <p>I eventually realized though, that trying to make a generic solution that worked for anything was dumb. Since I've already made several prototypes back in college, I already knew what my game was about, I just had to program it (again). I had six different enemy entities, one explosion entity, one player entity, and occasionally in different versions of my prototypes, I had one or two miscellaneous entities. But eventually, I realized all my entities had the same data, and only behaved differently. So now I'm just making one type of entity, and stack allocating a giant array for everything. Then based on the position of the array, I call different functions on the entities. It's very easy to do and cache friendly. It's not at all flexible, but since I already have the scope of my game figured out, I don't need the flexibility.</p> <p>And here's a screenshot of my game. It's jut a bunch of red squares for now. But I'm getting there.</p> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/HqCQAkW.png">]]></description>

    <title>A game a month</title>
    <link>http://obachuka.com/2016/07/04/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>My original plan was to practice drawing on the weekdays and work on code on the weeknds, and my goal was to release a short but finished video game every month. Looking at the progress I made this weekend, working only 2-3 days on a game per week isn't enough to finish it within a month. So I'll have to hold off on my drawings and code on the weekdays as well. Maybe once I get faster at this, I can pick up drawing again.</p> <p>The problem with code is that it's harder to show off than art, especially if I can't open source it. I'll have to get capture software and record my game. Tomorrow I'll have a gif to share.</p> ]]></description>

    <title>Screen resolutions</title>
    <link>http://obachuka.com/2016/07/03/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>Something I've always wondered was how 2D games handled screen resolutions. For 3D games, it doesn't matter as much since polygons can be scaled up, but images can't. I've seen <i>Transistor</i> master their art at both 720p and 1080p. Requiring HD at minimum seems common for modern games, which is reasonable. I doubt gamers will be using tiny screens, and even if they did, they should be well aware that some games just don't work on small screens.</p> <p>But what about aspect ratio? For some games, elements can be rearranged, but for games like side-scrolling shooters, changing the aspect ratio would affect the gameplay since the screen acts as the boundary for the playing field. This is a problem I'm having with my current game. I use vertical bars, but can't decide what to put in them. Having black bars is just ugly.</p> <p>Also, I won't be uploading anymore code. Even though I think it should be fine, I'm worried about the legal side of things.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Dynamically loading code</title>
    <link>http://obachuka.com/2016/07/02/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<p>I saw Casey Muratori in his <a href="https://handmadehero.org">Handmade Hero</a> series implement dynamic loading with C, and I thought I'd give it a try. It's a really cool idea that I've never seen before, but it looks so simple. Most people seem to opt to use scripting languages, even for smaller projects. <a href="https://github.com/obachuka/zuzu/commit/443ec0dee3d0da3de2c8abf97fcd752d4ead0b50">Commit</a></p> <p>On weekdays I plan on practicing my drawing, while on weekends, I'll do coding. Holidays count as weekends.</p>]]></description>

    <title>Self-reflection</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>When I was looking up reviews of Andrew Loomis's <i>Figure Drawing For All It's Worth</i>, there were a few minor complaints about the book being old-fashioned, especially towards the portrayal of women. One specific complaint was that in a diagram depicting a nude woman's proportions, the woman was wearing high-heels. It's just strange to me that their problem with women wearing high-heels is "old-fashioned."</p> <p>How about it's confusing as all hell?! That's my complaint. Why are they wearing something that alters their height in an educational nude to show proportions? Then Loomis actually makes meausements based of this woman wearing heels. Why, that's so confusing. I was able to remove the heels and figure out the proportions, but I'm not very bright, so it took me a while.</p> <p>Also, human figures are drawn at eight head lengths. Loomis acknowledges that people are of various heights and proportions, but when you're first starting out, it's easier to draw people at the "ideal" height of eight heads. And this height of eight heads is roughly six feet tall.</p> <p>I'm roughly six feet tall. So I thought I'd roughly match the measured human proportions, plus or minus some margin of error due to natural randomness. Turns out I don't match. According to Loomis, men's navels are higher than the waist, and the same height as the elbows. My navel is way down there, below my waist and far below my elbows. It never occurred to me that people's belly button location could vary so much. Now I'm obsessed about finding where other people's navels are.</p> <p>I'd ask my friends, "Yo where your belly buttons at?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Take off your shirt, I want to see your belly button."</p> <p>"Oba no."</p> <p>"How far down do your wrists go? Let me see your crotch."</p>]]></description>
