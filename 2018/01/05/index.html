      <h1>Balancing a Pencil</h1>

    <p>I tried making a game with Unity again. A lot of it still annoys me, but the speed of development makes up for it. The input handling in particular bugs me because it's locked to the current display framerate. I also tried my hand at Unreal, but the compile times were killer, even for adding small classes. </p>
    <p>I made a tiny thing about <a href="../../../games/pencil">balancing a pencil</a> using a custom shader that attempted to recreate the look discussed in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGjCzxJV3E">Guilty Gear video</a>. The pencil has a ton of aliasing because I'm not familiar with all the settings yet on Unity, but it didn't look as bad on my monitor. WebGL applications in general still take forever to load but hopefully this will be improved in the future.</p>
    <p>The pencil games was originally written in C, and the pencil was modelled in Blender. As a free software, Blender is great, but it didn't do a few minor things that I required. For one, I wanted to add extra per-vertex data. This is usually done by adding the information in the vertex colors as textures can provide color information. I wanted to store 4 values, meaning I would need to paint in rgba, but Blender only supports painting in rgb. Whatever, just put it in two vertex colors, and discard the 2 extra unused values when loading the model in my C application.</p>
    <p>The second thing I wanted was the ability to modify normals. The default normals look ugly, again as discussed in the Guilty Gear video. Blender by default doesn't do this, but an extension called Blend4Web does. However, the edited vertex normals don't export properly with some of the file formats Blender exports to. It worked with fbx and collada, but I was using ply in my game, which didn't work.</p>
    <p>Sick of handling files at this point, I switched to Unity. Unity handled all the low-level stuff I considered fun, but admittedly I was getting distracted. I learned a lot programming in C/C++ with few libraries, but after several months, I had little to show for it. Unity handled model loading for me, but it wasn't quite right. Turns out, Unity is a left-handed coordinate system while Blender is right-handed. I think everything should just standardize to right-handedness like the ancient Romans. Another weird thing is models are imported at a 90&deg because in Unity, Y is up while in Blender, Z is up. These small annoyances are easily fixed with my C code, but Unity doesn't have that sort of flexbility.</p>
    <p>Another thing Unity doesn't have are multiple vertex colors. They only support one. There was no way at this point to encode 4 values per-vertex with Blender. Now, I could write my own Blender extension to do it for me... but I just used Maya LT instead. While more costly, it also has much better normal editing tools than Blend4Web, and I found the overall UI slightly simpler as well. It took me back to my highschool days, where I did 3D modelling in SolidWorks with no extra instruction. One small annoyance is that Maya uses centimeters as the default unit, while Unity uses meters. You can of course, adjust the units, but I found when modelling large objects to scale, the objects got big enough to start clipping through the default camera viewport. Best to keep the models small and scale afterwards. UV and texturing is also much easier in Maya than in Blender for me.</p>
    <p>Over the past half-year or so, I've accumulated a lot of small projects written in C or C++, most of which I'll probably never release. But going forward, I think I'll stick to Unity and Maya for games.</p>
