    <p>Yesterday I was so proud of my explosions. Turns out there was a massive bug, and collisions didn't always happen properly for larger dots. I was still drawing them as squares when they should have been circles, so I assumed that the collision mistakes were just because the square image didn't match up with the real circle hitbox, and that once I switched to circles, it would be correct.</p>
    <p>Turns out no. My collisions were just wrong, and I didn't notice until I switched to circles (squares are easier to draw). Collisions are fixed now though, but I guess you should always practice with the real thing, otherwise you might not know you're doing it wrong until too late.</p>
