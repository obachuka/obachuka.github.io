    <p>When I was looking up reviews of Andrew Loomis's <i>Figure Drawing For All It's Worth</i>, there were a few minor complaints about the book being old-fashioned, especially towards the portrayal of women. One specific complaint was that in a diagram depicting a nude woman's proportions, the woman was wearing high-heels. It's just strange to me that their problem with women wearing high-heels is "old-fashioned."</p>
    <p>How about it's confusing as all hell?! That's my complaint. Why are they wearing something that alters their height in an educational nude to show proportions? Then Loomis actually makes meausements based of this woman wearing heels. Why, that's so confusing. I was able to remove the heels and figure out the proportions, but I'm not very bright, so it took me a while.</p>
    <p>Also, human figures are drawn at eight head lengths. Loomis acknowledges that people are of various heights and proportions, but when you're first starting out, it's easier to draw people at the "ideal" height of eight heads. And this height of eight heads is roughly six feet tall.</p>
    <p>I'm roughly six feet tall. So I thought I'd roughly match the measured human proportions, plus or minus some margin of error due to natural randomness. Turns out I don't match. According to Loomis, men's navels are higher than the waist, and the same height as the elbows. My navel is way down there, below my waist and far below my elbows. It never occurred to me that people's belly button location could vary so much. Now I'm obsessed about finding where other people's navels are.</p>
    <p>I'd ask my friends, "Yo where your belly buttons at?"</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Take off your shirt, I want to see your belly button."</p>
    <p>"Oba no."</p>
    <p>"How far down do your wrists go? Let me see your crotch."</p>
