    <p><a href="http://obachuka.com/FatDot/0.1.0/fat_dot.html">Here's my first version of the game!</a> It's only been tested on Chrome and Firefox. Any other browser is on their own. Input doesn't work on mobile phones either.</p>
    <p>There's still a bunch of bugs in this release, and I couldn't get text rendering working either, so I'm printing it to the console output. As I've said before, I want to replace my font code anyways.</p>
    <p>I want to give a shoutout to <a href="http://lyceum-allotments.github.io/">John Sharp's blog</a>. Emscripten has a lot of documentation, but for some reason, I could not find the basic usage instructions. And this guy has it all neatly compiled together on his blog.</p>
