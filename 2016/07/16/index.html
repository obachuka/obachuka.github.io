    <p>My basic gameplay is complete. The rest is adding more features and polish.</p>

    <p>While recording this, I noticed I had a bug with my replay/text. When a replay starts, the score disappears, and reappears when my score is updated. My entire game is stack allocated, so to save replays, I output all of the memory into a file, then read it back in again later. This wouldn't work for something dynamically allocated, as the memory will be in a different location on each replay. And guess what's the only thing that's dynamically allocated? That's right, the same font rendering I complained about yesterday. So when the replay starts, the memory for the score is invalid. Then when the score is updated, an entirely new texture is generated. I don't intend to fix this bug though, because once I switch to using images, I won't have this problem, since my images won't be dynamically updated in the middle of the game.</p>
