    <p>Technology is unreliable. My phone ran out of batteries, so it failed to wake me up at 6am this morning. Really, humans are unreliable. I should have remembered to turn it back on. So I didn't get anything done in the morning. I tried to make up for it after work, but all I ended up doing was making an "improvement" to my collision detection that didn't even compile (and never will), and made janky slow-mo.</p>
    <p>Because I'd been waking up at 6am for the past two weeks, I actually did wake up in time. But I just didn't get out of bed because I didn't hear my alarm. I need to sleep with a clock next to my bed.</p>
