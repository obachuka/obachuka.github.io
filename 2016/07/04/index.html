    <p>My original plan was to practice drawing on the weekdays and work on code on the weeknds, and my goal was to release a short but finished video game every month. Looking at the progress I made this weekend, working only 2-3 days on a game per week isn't enough to finish it within a month. So I'll have to hold off on my drawings and code on the weekdays as well. Maybe once I get faster at this, I can pick up drawing again.</p>
    <p>The problem with code is that it's harder to show off than art, especially if I can't open source it. I'll have to get capture software and record my game. Tomorrow I'll have a gif to share.</p>
