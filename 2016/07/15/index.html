      <h1>Rendering dumb C strings</h1>

    <p>One of the few things I actually like about high level languages is their string handling. Strings in C are mad annoying. I tried rendering a score to my game using SDL2_ttf, and tell it the font, string, position, width, and height of where to draw the text. But it doesn't display at a standard font size, e.g. 16pt font if I specify 16pt. Instead, the text is converted into a texture and stretched to fit the whole drawing area.</p>

    <p>That's dumb. But this ain't a high level language. This is C. So to get around this, I just formatted the string to begin with a bunch of leading 0s.</p>

    <p>But that looks ugly. And my font is still pixellated, most definitely because the texture is still being stretched. Honestly, if if the font is going to be converted into a texture and look ugly doing it, I might as well create my own font using images. I try to avoid using strings anyways, even if I'm using Java or Python.</p>
