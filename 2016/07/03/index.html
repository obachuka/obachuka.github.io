    <p>Something I've always wondered was how 2D games handled screen resolutions. For 3D games, it doesn't matter as much since polygons can be scaled up, but images can't. I've seen <i>Transistor</i> master their art at both 720p and 1080p. Requiring HD at minimum seems common for modern games, which is reasonable. I doubt gamers will be using tiny screens, and even if they did, they should be well aware that some games just don't work on small screens.</p>
    <p>But what about aspect ratio? For some games, elements can be rearranged, but for games like side-scrolling shooters, changing the aspect ration would affect the gameplay since the screen acts as the boundary for the playing field. This is a problem I'm having with my current game. I use vertical bars, but can't decide what to put in them. Having black bars is just ugly.</p>
    <p>Also, I won't be uploading anymore code. Even though I think it should be fine, I'm worried about the legal side of things.</p>
