    <p>I have explosions in my game now. Next I need to make my dots actual circles instead of squares. Then a game over state, more dots, sound, and high scores. That seems pretty doable within two weeks. I got most of the hard parts out of the way, I know how to do the rest quite easily.</p>

    <p>Apparently my videos haven't been showing up on a lot of people's devices. I'll switch to gifs next time, after I figure it out.</p>
