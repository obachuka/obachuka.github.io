      <h1>Blindspot</h1>

    <p>I've made this game multiple times now, as it's my "hello world" for video game technology. The rules are simple and everything is a circle. In every iteration of my game, I always had a dot that followed the player around, and this dot had always had a blindspot. If the dot got within a certain radius of the player, it slowed down. Having the dot always track the player got tiring, so I included the blindspot to give the player some breathing space. Unlike the other dots, this dot was actually easier to avoid if the player stayed in the same spot. My friends playtested this game, but very few of them ever realized that.</p>

    <p>This time though, the radius of the blindspot fluctuates. If the player moves fast and is constantly outside the dots' blindspots, these dots eventually begin overlapping each other. With the changing radius, even though they still clump together, they won't overlap completely now. Plus, this keeps the breathing space the player gets from being too rigid.</p>
