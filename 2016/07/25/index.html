    <p>I didn't work on my game today, but I'll still consider it a success. I reset my sleep schedule, started exercising again, and now I'm going to bed before 10PM.</p>
    <p>I still feel like there's so much to do, but this is my last week. Whatever I have at the end of this week, I'm publishing it. Just a bit more to do. I've published my code <a href="https://github.com/obachuka/FatDot">on GitHub</a> if you want to see the dumb stuff I did to get it all working.</p>
