      <h1>Magic replays</h1>

    <p>I was able to implement replays by writing the memory and inputs to a file, then reading them back in. I'm beginning to appreciate the power of C. Being able to manipulate arbitrary bits of memory made this really easy. I did this in less than an hour. Now I'm able record myself, make a change in the code, and see the effects in real time. Compile times are also fast, and I don't think my code base will ever get big enough for longer compile times.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile at work, it took me four hours to compile some Python code because of dependency hell. I actually have to build the Python code every time I want to see my changes, because the janky build system does some black magic file copying and linking. The build takes a few seconds, completely removing one of the best things about dynamic languages: no compile time.</p>
    <p>I like personal projects because I can keep them small. Look at this.</p>
