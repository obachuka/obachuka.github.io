      <h1>Invincible spikes</h1>

    <p>I introduced invincible spikes today. Spikes means a dot is invincible, while a gray outline means that a dot <i>can</i> turn invincible.</p>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/bjTq8YL.gif"/>
    <p>The player dot uses the same spikes and outline to denote when the player is attacking and when the player is ready to attack.</p>
    <p>I made invincible dots to introduce a different type of difficulty in later levels. That's right, my game will have levels. Levels is my last "necessary" feature before I am willing to say my game is in a finished state.</p>
    <h3>Here are my remaining required tasks:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Levels</li>
      <li>Compile to Windows 10</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Here are my remaining optional tasks:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sound</li>
      <li>Purple dot</li>
      <li>Saving high scores</li>
      <li>Power up pick up</li>
      <li>Better font rendering</li>
      <li>Hard mode</li>
      <li>Compile to OS X</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Here are tasks I've given up on finishing:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use OpenGL directly</li>
      <li>Animation</li>
      <li>Music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reason I put "levels" above something like "sound" is because my game is honestly quite boring without it. It might have been the primary reason my game was fun. I'll go into more detail when I actually make the levels.</p>
