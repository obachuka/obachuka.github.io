    <p>Dreph used one hand to scale the attic stairs, and in the other clutched an assortment of chocolate coins. His tail hung limp, occasionally thumping against the stairs with each awkward step until he reached the top.</p>
    <p>In the middle of the wooden floor, a concave depression made of frosted glass held the only light source in the dark attic: a small, pale girl whose white dress and bleached skin gave off a soft glow of the waning moon. She was curled up into a ball, resting in the glass nest, and her light was slightly pulsating.</p>
    <p>"Lira," he whispered at her.</p>
    <p>Dreph took a step towards her, and the wooden floor creaked. The glowing girl raised her head and scanned the room, but completely passes over Dreph.</p>
    <p>"I'm over here," he said.</p>
    <p>Lira turned to face Dreph, though her eyes never quite made contact with his.</p>
    <p>"Are you hungry?" he asked and made his way over to her. He opened his hand to offer his chocolate coins, but the coins were crushed and melted chocolate oozed out between the aluminum seams.</p>
    <p>"Oh no, they're melted. I had chocolate to give you," Dreph said, his ears drooping.</p>
    <p>Lira held out her hand, palm up.</p>
    <p>"You still want them?"</p>
    <p>She nodded her head.</p>
    <p>Dreph dropped the coins in her hand, and smudging some of her light. The girl rubbed the coins between her fingers, smearing her hands further.</p>
    <p>"You're getting your hands dirty!" Dreph said.</p>
    <p>"They're pretty," she said.</p>
    <p>"You can see them?"</p>
    <p>"No. But they feel shiny. And also sweet."</p>
    <p>She felt them some more, then asked, "Can I keep them?"</p>
    <p>"I gave them to you. It's food, you can eat them."</p>
    <p>"Oh I can't do that."</p>
    <p>"You're not going to eat them?"</p>
    <p>"But they're pretty," Lira placed the gold coins along the side of her glass nest. "I think they're good here. There's no colors up here."</p>
    <p>Dreph looked at the pail girl reclining in her hole. Her small body fit the cavity so perfectly. She'd never grow up if she never left.</p>
    <p>"You should come down! We have a lot of colors downstairs. Pappy has a bunch of old paintings, older than him. And there's this big fireplace in the kitchen that has red and yellow and sometimes blue. Oh but you can't touch that. But, but we have this garden with a bunch flowers and stuff you can touch. I don't like it much, because it makes me sneeze, but I'm sure you'd like it, there's a lot of different colors there."</p>
    <p>The girl shook her head.</p>
    <p>Dreph frowned, "Why not?"</p>
    <p>"I have to stay here. It's my job."</p>
    <p>"You're not tired?"</p>
    <p>"Well... I am tired. But I can't leave."</p>
    <p>"I wanted to give you food because you've been getting darker."</p>
    <p>The girl shot straight up, her light pulsating quicker, "I'm getting darker?!"</p>
    <p>"Pappy says he'll have to change you soon. So you'll be able to come down."</p>
    <p>"You can't change me! You can't change me! I can still light!" she exclaimed, jumping to her feet. She clenched her teeth and her hair stood on end, buzzing with static. The room grew brighter and brighter, and the girl's body hummed with light.</p>
    <p>"Wow Lira! You really can!"</p>
    <p>Pop! The room fell into darkness and Lira crumpled to the floor and hit her glass chamber with a follow thud.</p>
    <p>"Lira! Lira! Are you okay?!" Unable to see her, Dreph reached down into the basin felt through the darkness. His fingers graced against her skin, which was hot to the touch, and he jerked back.</p>
    <p>"Are you okay?" he asked again. Quietly at first, he heard her sobbing.</p>
    <p>"I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I still want to see."</p>
    <p>"You can still see. When Pappy puts the new light in, you can come down."</p>
    <p>"No! Don't you know there's no use for things like me if I can't light?! I'm garbage, he'll throw me away!"</p>
    <p>"That's not true! Pappy wouldn't do that!"</p>
    <p>"It is! It's what happens to things like me! We're always-"</p>
    <p>Heavy footsteps came up the stairs.</p>
    <p>Despite arguing to the contrary, hearing his grandfather's footsteps made Dreph panick.</p>
    <p>"Quick, hide!"</p>
    <p>"Hide?! I'm supposed to show off!"</p>
    <p>"But you're broken!"</p>
    <p>"Broken...? I-I," Lira stammered. "Bu-I'm, there's nowhere to hide!"</p>
    <p>The old man reached the top of the stairs, and with a snap, brought forth from his fingertips a small flame that outlined his grumpy face.</p>
    <p>"Why are the lights turned out?" he asked Dreph. "What're you doing up here anyhow?"</p>
    <p>Dreph ran up to the man and hugged his leg.</p>
    <p>"Please, oh please don't change Lira!"</p>
    <p>"What? Who's Lira?"</p>
    <p>The girl in the glass nest stoop up, shivering, the small flame revealing patches of blackened skin.</p>
    <p>"Please sir," she pleaded. "Just give me more time. I can still light."</p>
    <p>The old man massaged his eyes, "Oh cripes, I forgot this was still up here. Get off me lil' bastard."</p>
    <p>The old man shook Dreph off his leg</p>
