    <p>I didn't get much done in the morning, then in the evening, I went to the movies with my friedns. I still managed to write a few lines of code though, so I'm still counting that as a success. In the game over screen, I'm going to leave one dot behind, and use that as the start button. I want it so that players can't start the game without knowing how to play. An invisible tutorial of sorts. I'll talk more about it tommorrow, I'm tired today.</p>
