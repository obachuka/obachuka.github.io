    <p>I normally implement a quadtree for spatial partitioning, and did so for my last implementation of this game. But my quadtree ended up being evenly divided all the time, since the location of my game entities were roughly evenly distributed. So this time, I tried to go for a simple grid. Below, I've divided the space into four cells, one for each corner, and highlighted in purple all the squares in the bottom right corner.</p>

    <p>As you can see, that is not at all the bottom right corner. I'll have to debug this tomorrow.</p>
