    <p>I saw Casey Muratori in his <a href="https://handmadehero.org">Handmade Hero</a> series implement dynamic loading with C, and I thought I'd give it a try. It's a really cool idea that I've never seen before, but it looks so simple. Most people seem to opt to use scripting languages, even for smaller projects. <a href="https://github.com/obachuka/zuzu/commit/443ec0dee3d0da3de2c8abf97fcd752d4ead0b50">Commit</a></p>
    <p>On weekdays I plan on practicing my drawing, while on weekends, I'll do coding. Holidays count as weekends.</p>
