      <h1>Failure #1</h1>

    <p>Today, I made no progress. On anything. I've been struggling the entire last two weeks to get stuff done. I'm just so tired. When I'm tired late at night, I make terrible decisions. One terrible decision I always make is to not go to bed. So I get more sleepy, then I resist going to sleep more. I took a break one weekend and slept in, but I think that made it harder. My sleep schedule was ruined and I still didn't want to do anything; I just wanted to continue to lie in bed even though I was no longer sleepy.</p>
    <p>I titled this as "Failure #1" because I know I'll fail again. I want to keep track of when and how often I fail. After all, I started this blog as an exercise in self-discipline, which I think is one of my weakest traits. It's 1:30am now, and I'm tired. But tomorrow... tomorrow, I will wake up at 6am and try again.</p>
