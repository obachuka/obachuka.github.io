    <p>I didn't make a post yesterday, but I won't count that as missing a day because I actually did a lot of work yesterday. As of today, my game is gameplay complete. It's still missing sound, and I want to fix a few UI problems and other bugs. But I consider those minor changes. There won't be any dramatic changes in the game from here. <a href="http://obachuka.com/FatDot/0.2.0/fat_dot.html">Check it out here</a>.</p>
