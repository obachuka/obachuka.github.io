      <h1>First digital drawing<h1>
    </header>
    <p>I tried my hand at my first digital drawing using Krita. I can't seem to figure out how brushes work. Look at my strokes, especially around the hairline. They seem to overlap each other. That's additive blending or whatever.</p>

    <p>If I release my pen and put it down again, it doubles the value. I don't want that. A real pencil would let me draw over the same area, and keep the same value. I suppose I could just use a brush that's completely opaque, and just overwrite whatever value is currently there. But real pencils don't do that either, they let me increase the value if I press harder.</p>
    <p>There's probably a mode that lets me do that, probably darken only. But really, I shouldn't have to think about that. Why isn't there a "behave like a real life pencil" button? There's no way that's an uncommon request. Perhaps it's not possible. There is a pencil "brush," but it doesn't behave at all like a real pencil, it behaves like a disobedient child that needs a good cuff on the ears.</p>
    <p>Then there's this nonsense.<p>

    <p>This was the brush I was using for most of the sketch. Then I clicked on something or other, and now I can't get it to go back. Looks like the background of the brush isn't transparent. That seems like a bug to me.</p>
    <p>I've tried out Paint Tool SAI before, and it's much easier to use. But I use Linux, and rebooting into Windows every time to draw is a huge hassle. Paint Tool SAI doesn't work with WINE unfortunately. Besides, it doesn't have the "behave like a real pencil" button. It does have one that's close, but not quite.</p>
    <p>Maybe I should try turning off the pressure sensitivity on my tablet. Pressure is overrated anyways, paint isn't really pressure sensitive.</p>
    <p>Really, I've just got to suck it up and learn how digital drawing works, as brushes and blending modes seem to be the standard in art software everywhere.</p>
