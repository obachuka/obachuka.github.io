      <h1>Hello world with Emscripten and SDL2</h1>

    <p>I tried my hand at compiling C to Javascript using Emscripten. I had trouble getting Emscripten ports working using the default version that comes on Ubuntu 16.04, so I had to build the latest version from source. Xenial Xerus released this year, and it's still out of date.</p>
    <p>I created a color changing window you can view <a href="http://obachuka.com/zuzu/2016//06/26/zuzu.html">here</a>. The goal is to eventually create a game that also runs in the browser. I hate creating stuff for the web, but I also hate downloading stuff from sites I don't trust. So as the user, I appreciate web ports.</p>
    <p>I should note that I compiled the color changing window without any optimization flags. It wouldn't work on Chrome when I used them, but they did on Firefox. I'm assuming it's because Chrome hasn't fully implemented asm.js or something else like that. But I want everything I put on the web to work on both Chrome and Firefox.</p>
    <p>To hell with anything else.</p>
