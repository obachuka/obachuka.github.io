      <h1>Jacking up blog post count</h1>

    <p>I didn't write a blog post this morning. Once I slip up once, I tend to procrastinate more. I need to be stricter about going to bed on time, and to finish something in the morning before work. Because once work starts, I'll be too lazy afterwards to do anything. And if I'm tired, I'm slower at work at get home later and go to bed later. It's a vicious cycle.</p>
    <p>I almost considered just skipping today and picking it back up first thing tomorrow, but I forced myself to do <i>something</i>. What did I do?</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/obachuka/zuzu/commit/57666b076489b10ebbd2d0d811c61e715cce0017">I renamed my C structs to use lower_case capitalization</a></p>
    <p>Pretty pointless, I admit. It's like cheating on your NanoWrimo word count. But I want to do this more to build up that habit than anything else. This blog if focused on quantity, not quality.</p>
    <p>And besides, lower_case naming seems more C-like. I already know the object will be a struct or a union, because I won't typedef it. It felt weird having everything being lower_case ExceptForStructs. And I don't like typedef'ing in general. I never understood the point of abstraction, it always made things less clear to me. Whenever I looked through library code that made extensive use of typedef's, I'd just end up searching for the definition of that typedef. Then that'll also have a typedef, so I'd search that up too. Blegh.</p>
    <p>I'm sick of the way I code at work, with tons of abstraction, classes, and configuration. That's why I used C instead of C++: no classes. My code will probably end up with tons of anti-patterns.</p>
    <p>Yeah whatever.</p>
