    <p>I started following Andrew Loomis's <i>Figure Drawing For All It's Worth</i>. Apparently, it's <i>the</i> book for figure drawing. I did these in less than an hour.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I'm not making enough progress. Even if I make this a habit and practice every day, an hour of practice isn't enough to get where I want to be. Let's say outside of work, sleep, eating, and miscellaneous, I have around 4-6 hours of free time. I need to be making the most of that time, not just an hour. I will have to cut the internet out completely; it's a waste of time. I also have roughly 2-3 hours in the morning before I go to work. But I take too long to do anything productive; it takes me an hour just to fully wake up. That's too long. I need to get better sleep. I've tried a lot of things to get better sleep, but really, I just need to be more rigorous about my sleep schedule. I've been getting up at 6am this entire week so far, so I'm off to a good start, but now I just need to maintain it.</p>
    <p>Back to the drawings themselves, they're completely off. But I think the lengths are mostly right, I need to get the widths more accurate next. The first chapter in the book is all about proportion, so that's what I'm trying to focus on. The thing that will help me most though, is more practice.</p>
