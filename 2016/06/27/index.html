    <p>I've wanted to draw characters for a long time now, but I don't know anything about anatomy. I didn't even know how to draw. So I practiced my lines, my boxes, my perspective, my forms, my shading. It was never good enough.</p>
    <p>Saying "never good enough" makes me sound like a perfectionist, slaving for hours over my drawings. On the contrary, I put minimal effort into them. I just got bored of still life. I used pencil and a massive canvas (or at least, felt massive to me). Shading things the right value with that tiny pencil nib took forever. It was a tedious process, and just not very fun.</p>
    <p>I wanted to do people, I wanted to do imaginaray landscapes. But I wasn't ready.</p>
    <p>I've thought about making this blog for a while now, to chronicle my learning progress, so that one day should I ever be successful, I can point others to this meager blog and tell them the tale of my journey. But I wasn't ready! I haven't got anything to show off! I haven't learned anything worth sharing!</p>
    <p>And so the months went by and nothing happened. Then one day I bought my domain, and that was it.</p>
    <p>Today, I spent ten minutes doing gesture drawings with poses, with the <a href="http://www.posemaniacs.com">posemaniacs website</a>.</p>

    <p>I'm quite proud to say, it was a complete failure.</p>
