    <p>I spent more of today drawing flat figures of women and men of various heights. It's more or less the same thing as yesterday. I figured it wouldn't be interesting showing the same thing for two posts in a row, and decided to share one of my first pieces of artwork instead.</p>

    <p>This was my first finished watercolor from a year ago, and took me two days. I was quite proud of it, since I'd never done anything like it before, in terms both watercolor and effort spent. I used a reference piece of art from the movie <i>Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</i>. I thought my reference was drawn by Hayao Miyazaki, but I don't actually remember any more.</p>
    <p>My brother gave me a ton of useful critque, that I was unfortunately never able to incorporate into my later art, because I never made any more art afterwards. Moving forward though, I hope to make use of his advice. The contrast was low, the palette was muddled, the strokes were unfinished, and the textures were flat. I'll improve upon these in my next watercolor.</p>
