    <p>I had a blog back in the day, where I'd post stories every day. It was quite fun, and even though only two or three people read it, it still made me never want to miss a day. Just because I knew someone was watching.</p>
    <p>This is the same idea. This is my road to perfection. The goal is to post something here that I worked on every day, whether it's a short story, a rushed sketch, or even a game. My skills are subpar, but hopefully I'll improve along the way and I'll document what I learn here.</p>
    <p>Today I set up this "blog" with no frameworks, just HTML and CSS by hand. It's not quite a real blog yet, because I don't even have an RSS feed. I might just manually write one every day. Something I've learned in the software industry is that humans are prone to mistakes. That's why everything's automated, to prevent those mistakes. And that's a shame. I'll be doing this blog by hand.</p>
    <p>And maybe one day, I'll break everything.</p>
    <p>That's the dream.</p>
