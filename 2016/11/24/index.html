      <h1>Fat Dot Thanksgiving update</h1>

    <p>Happy Thanksgiving! This year, I'm thankful for being the most awesome guy I know. To celebrate my inflated ego, I gave Fat Dot an update.</p>
    <p>This is a gameplay change this time. The way you play the game is still the same, but I made shrinking easier to understand, as in you now shrink automatically. The boundary's behavior was changed to end and score your combo. This change came about because I didn't like how the clicking behavior changed when an existing combo was already in progress. Plus, some players wouldn't regularly shrink themselves. The game is a bit easier now that the shrinking is automatic, but you still have to decide whether or not you want to continue your combo. A side effect of this update means that you can now extend your combos further by starting another explosion. I think there's more strategy this way.</p>
    <p>That said, it's hard to know the actual outcome of this update, because I haven't really play tested it. And since I don't have any sort of testing (who needs that?), it's hard to tell if I introduced any bugs. It's been a while since my last update here, and coming back to my code after a few months, I noticed there were side effects everywhere. Any small change could result in a bug. I started out my code with the intention of violating several best practices, and it was fun to code differently from when I code for work.</p>
    <p>So if you find any bugs, let me know. Love y'all.</p>
