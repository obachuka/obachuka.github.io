    <p>I made some text updates, so hopefully it's more clear how to play the game. I said I wasn't going to add any more feautures, but I got so much done today, that I figured I could go ahead and add sound. It took me six hours, and sound still doesn't work. It's infuriating. I hate sound. Anyways, play the newest version <a href="http://obachuka.com/FatDot/0.2.1/fat_dot.html">here</a>.</p>
