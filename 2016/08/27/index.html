      <h1>Converting height to normal maps</h1>

    <p>For my next game, I want to experiment with my own 2D rendering. I'll need normal maps for what I'm planning, so I wrote my own small little converter to transform height maps to normal maps. I know programs already exist that can do this for you, but I wanted to try my own hand at it. I stole the following height map of a volcano from the internet somewhere.</p>

    <p>Here is the result:</p>

    <p>Red is the x axis, with full red pointing to the right, and green is the y axis, with full green pointing up. All vectors are normalized, with blue pointing outwards to the viewer. Looking at other people's normal maps, these look correct, but I won't actually know until I use them to render.</p>
