    <p>I practiced drawing; more of the same really. I wonder if there's any point in updating every day. It's just me saying, "Hey. Check me out. I did something today."</p>
    <p>Maybe I should get rid of the rss feed. This is really just a way to hold me accountable; people shouldn't actually be reading these low effort posts.</p>
