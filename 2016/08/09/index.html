    <p>I've been programming too much recently, I want to practice other things. Today I drew some side figures at different heights.</p>

    <p>I wonder if I think too hard while drawing. When I practice other things like piano, I am focused, but I don't think much. Instead it's really just about repeating until its' right. For drawing, I'm thinking too much about "getting it right" instead of just speed running everything. I'll think less tomorrow.</p>
