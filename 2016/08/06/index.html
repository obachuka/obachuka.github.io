    <p>My last update was garbage. I broke high scores and collision detection. I fixed the high scores, but I think the collision is still somewhat wrong. I think the best way to fix it is to just redo parts of my code. But I won't do that. I will take a look at how other people made their games though.</p>
    <p>I also included a hard mode. I think the only thing missing now is sound.</p>
