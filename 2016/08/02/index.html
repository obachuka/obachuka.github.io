    <p>I've been making minor imporvements to my game, such as an indicator to show when you can click again. I know I said I wanted to make a game a month, and that I'd stop working on this game after July. But I'm kind of tired, and after the feedback I'm recieving for my game, I want to improve it. Doing a game a month is too much for me. This month, I'm going to make minor improvements, practice some art, and research how other people made their game engines. The way I handled my object pools was done rather poorly, so I'd like to improve upon that.<a href="http://obachuka.com/FatDot/0.2.2/fat_dot.html"> Newest version here</a>.</p>
