    <p>I've added sound to my game. And with that, the last item on my todo list is done. Any updates going forward will be bug fixes or minor balance changes. I took a bit of a break this week, but I'm ready to get back to work. I'll start my next game at the start of September, and until then, I'm going to study and better prepare myself than I did for Fat Dot. It will be an Asteroids clone, with the gimmick that it will be in low orbit.</p>
